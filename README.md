I'm passionate about design with extensive experience in various tools and programming languages. My journey started with Dreamweaver, Flash, and Fireworks, creating my first website for La Curva Resto-Bar. I later developed websites for Madero Wellness, a catering service, and Adri√°n Otero.

In 2023, I expanded my knowledge at UTN e-learning, mastering HTML 5, CSS 3, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. I graduated with honors as a Professional Frontend Developer and created a comprehensive website for a pet shop product company (PAZ ANIMAL).

In 2024, I completed a Development course at CODERHOUSE, learning React Native, Firebase, and Redux Toolkit, and built a mobile e-commerce app.

Currently, I'm studying English at CODERHOUSE to enhance my job opportunities. I'm seeking new challenges to apply my skills and knowledge in exciting projects.
