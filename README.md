# üëã Hi, I'm Ariel A. Salvia  

## üí° About Me  
I'm passionate about **design and web development**, with a journey that combines creativity, continuous learning, and growth in the digital world.  

My path started with **Dreamweaver, Flash, and Fireworks**, where I built my first website for **La Curva Resto-Bar**. Later, I developed projects for **Madero Wellness**, a **catering service**, and musician **Adri√°n Otero**.  

In **2023**, I graduated with honors as a **Frontend Developer** at **UTN e-learning**, mastering **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Bootstrap**, and built a complete website for the pet product company **PAZ ANIMAL**.  

In **2024**, I studied at **Coderhouse**, learning **React Native, Firebase, and Redux Toolkit**, and developed a **mobile e-commerce app**. I also completed **Foundations of UX Design**.  

In **July 2025**, I finished **UI Design with Figma**, sharpening my skills to create user-centered digital experiences.  

Currently, I'm starting my **Fullstack Development journey with Node.js**, beginning with **Python**, and studying **English** to expand my opportunities in international projects.
